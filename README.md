##Sentiment Score
The sentiment score of the text was found to be 1.7185 from a scale of 0-4 in which 0 indicates a negative score and 4 a positive score. The score indicates the text is slightly negative which matches my own expectation of a generally neutral score. The scores for individual sentences of the text match my expectations. For example, the phrase 'You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. ' returns a score of 0 as it describes anger, a negative emotion. However, other phrases I expected to carry a positive or negative sentiment returned a neutral value due to not evaluating context.
I used Sentiwordnet from nltk and Stanza from Stanford core NLP
